	 - The PostFixEvaluator class uses the java.util.Stack class to create the stack attribute. 
	 - The java.util.Stack class is one of two stack implementations provided by Java Collections API

	 SECTION 3.6 A STACK ADT 
	 
	  Interface: Defines a set of abstract methods and is useful in separating the concept of an abstract data type
	  from its implementation. 
	  	  
	  Stacks are used often in the real world -> Undo function in a word processor 
	  
	  Drop-out Stack: Same as regular stack but it has a limit on the # of elements it will hold, and once that 
	  limit is reached the element on the bottom of the stack drops off 
	  
	  Keep in mind  the separation between the collection and underlying data structure used to implement it. We 
	  can use an array to create the Stack data structure.

	 SECTION 3.7: IMPLEMENTING A STACK: WITH ARRAYS 
	 When an array object is created, it is allocated a specific number of cells into which elements can be stored
	 Object [ ] collection = Object[500];
